# HydroHub
HydroHub is a smart water bottle built for the I2E Semester Long Engineering Competition/Class at NYU. 
It has the capabilities to read real time temperature of liquids, track water intake, and remind users to stay hydrated when needed while also being able to interface with devices through bluetooth.
